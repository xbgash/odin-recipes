    <img src='images/culture.png' alt="Perhaps you know someone in your school or community from a different country. Ask them how their food is served and how their table is set. Take notes and make sketches! If you do not know anyone, research a different countryâ€™s cuisine and table setting. Research another. You may find both the food and the presentation of the food fascinating! Make a poster with at least three different settings. Label the pieces and show a world map where the countries are located."
