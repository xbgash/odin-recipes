        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped</li>

    <h4>Recipe instruction (taken from the book)</h4>
    <ol>
     <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease a broiler pan with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
     <li>Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Brush with remaining olive oil until coated. Sprinkle each piece evenly on both sides with paprika, lemon-pepper, and salt. Place on the prepared broiler pan, sprinkle garlic over top, and sprinkle onions around the base of the chicken, with several smaller pieces on top.</li>
     <li>Cook under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes. Flip and continue to cook, checking often, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
